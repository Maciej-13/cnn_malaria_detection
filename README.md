# Malaria detection with Convolutional Neural Networks
Repository containing the project created for Machine Learning 2 class. 

## Goal
The goal of this researh project is to come up with a Convolutional Neural Network model that will be able to correctly 
classify the healthy and infected cells based on their image. In addition the code created for this project shall be
robust and reusable for other image classification applications.

## Contents
* Modelling directory contains files with classes for CNN models, Transfer Learning models and handling image data
* Visualization directory contains file with classes used for purposes of plotting the data and results
* Notebooks directory contains the final report with modelling results and example usage of modelling classes
